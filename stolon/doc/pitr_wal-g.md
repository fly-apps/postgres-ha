## Point in time recovery with wal-g

[wal-g](https://github.com/wal-g/wal-g) is the successor of wal-e, which no longer seems to be in active development!
This example shows how to do point in time recovery with stolon using [wal-g](https://github.com/wal-g/wal-g)

[wal-g](https://github.com/wal-g/wal-g) correctly suggests to not put environment variables containing secret data (like aws secret keys) inside the `archive_command` since every user connected to postgres could read them. In its examples wal-g suggests to use the `envdir` command to set the wal-g required environment variables or (since some distribution don't have it) just use a custom script that sets them.

### Backups

#### Base backups

Take the base backups using the `wal-g backup-push` command.

#### Archive backups

For doing this you should set at least the `archive_mode` and the `archive_command` pgParameters in the cluster spec. Wal-g will be used as the archive command:

```
stolonctl update --patch '{ "pgParameters" : { "archive_mode": "on", "archive_command": "envdir /etc/wal-g.d/env wal-g wal-push %p" } }'
```


### Execute a point in time recovery

Note: looks like wal-g doesn't backups various config files like `postgresql.conf`, `pg_hba.conf`. While `pg_hba.conf` is currently generated by stolon, you'd like to keep the previous postgres parameters after the restore. For doing this there're two different ways:

* if you want to backup the `postgresql.conf` you should do this outside `wal-g`.  To restore it you have to create a `dataRestoreCommand` that will restore it after the `wal-g backup fetch` command.
* if you don't want to backup/restore it than you can just set all the `pgParameters` inside the [cluster specification](cluster_spec.md)

```
stolonctl init '{ "initMode": "pitr", "pitrConfig": { "dataRestoreCommand": "envdir /etc/wal-g.d/env wal-g backup-fetch %d LATEST" , "archiveRecoverySettings": { "restoreCommand": "envdir /etc/wal-g.d/env wal-g wal-fetch \"%f\" \"%p\"" } } }'
```
